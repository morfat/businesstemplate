<h3>Benefits of Home Automation</h3>
 
<p> 
An automated home coordinates security, temperatures, lighting, and audio/video automatically for safety, 
energy savings, and convenience. Automatically dimming lights and changing heating and cooling setpoints 
when you are away from home can greatly reduce energy costs. Remote access lets you view security video on 
a laptop or web-enabled cell phone. Adding home automation can also increase the value of your home.Cameras 
monitor loved ones and protect against intruders. One-touch lighting control sets the perfect scene for any
 occasion, while multi-room audio lets users enjoy their favorite artists inside or outside the home. Cutting 
 edge intercoms make room to room communication as simple
 as pressing a button, and mobile access keeps users connected and in control of their homes regardless of location.

 <h3>Industrial Automation</h3>
<p>
With increasing appetite of industry for integrated automation; techlogic focuses on 
Integrated automation solutions that not only involve multi-motor industrial drive systems
 & PLC that control the concerned process; but also those with real time data-communication
 bus for the front end automation systems and higher level automation systems like SCADA and MIS 
 systems. Over past decade or so, connectivity of front-end automation systems like Variable speed 
 Drives and PLCs with PCs has been well established. It is now possible to use the real-time status 
 information (of the process being controlled) for process visualization, supervisory control;
 process parameter saving and archiving, statistical process parameter analysis; higher level MIS systems etc.
